 * Bounding to the band (not the whole above-anchor history) is load-bearing on
 * two counts:
 *
 *   - Correctness: only rows near the fold realize/reflow as the user scrolls
 *     up into them and thereby move the anchor *this frame*. Rows hundreds of px
 *     above scrolled past long ago; they quietly de-realize back toward their
 *     reserve as they leave the viewport, and summing that drift (which no walk
 *     re-synced) is exactly what pins `aboveShift` to a large bogus value.
 *   - Cost: the timeline is not DOM-virtualized — every message is a
 *     `.timeline-row-cv` — so an unbounded walk is O(channel) per realization
 *     frame. The band is viewport-sized, O(visible rows).
 *
 * Because the band is small and its rows are on-screen, this walk maintains the
 * height cache in place for band rows: a row's `last` is refreshed to its
 * current height every walk, so `height - last` is the single-frame reflow. A
 * band row's first sighting is seeded from its `contain-intrinsic-size` reserve
 * so a realization counts as its true `realized - reserve` delta (see
 * `reservedRowHeight`). Rows outside the band are neither read nor written.
 *
 * The iteration is bounded to the band, not just the sum: we start at the
 * anchor's own `.timeline-row-cv` and walk PRECEDING rows in document order via
 * a `TreeWalker`, stopping the moment a row falls below the band floor. Because
 * rows are laid out top-to-bottom in document order, everything before that
 * floor is older still, so the break is safe. This avoids the O(channel)
 * `querySelectorAll(".timeline-row-cv")` enumeration every frame — critical now
 * that the walk runs on every mid-history frame, not only realization frames.
 *
 * It is the SECOND, independent instrument the rAF writer cross-checks against
 * the anchor's net document-position shift (`computeAnchorCorrection`): the two
 * agree only when the net shift is genuinely an above-anchor reflow, not a
 * straddling-row miscount or scroll artifact.

  // `snapshotReadingAnchor` forces THIS frame's layout — including any
  // `content-visibility` realization — into the read. So the sampler observes a
  // realization same-frame, and a `scrollTo` issued here lands before the frame
  // paints. That is the whole cross-engine fix: on WebKit the ResizeObserver for
  // the same realization delivers one frame LATE (paint N, RO N+1), so an
  // RO-driven correction snaps visibly; correcting in the rAF that forced the
  // layout collapses N+1 → N. On Chromium the same rAF read sees the realization
  // same-frame too, so the single writer is correct on both engines.
  //
  // Two instruments, read from ONE forced-layout pass so they describe the SAME
  // realization (never a late-carried prior one):
  //   1. `observedShift` — the anchor row's net document-position delta since
  //      the previous frame's (pre-realization) snapshot. Cheap: two snapshots,
  //      no row walk. Scroll-invariant (`scrollTop + topOffset`): the user's own
  //      scroll moves both equal-and-opposite, so this is the reflow alone.
  //   2. `aboveShift` — the per-row-attributed sum of height deltas for rows
  //      laid out ABOVE the anchor (`sumAboveAnchorShift`), against the shared
  //      height cache. This is the SUFFICIENCY cross-check: `observedShift`
  //      alone moves for any reason (a straddling row miscount, an anchor-row
  //      top-edge resize), so we correct only when the two AGREE — that is the
  //      evidence the net shift is a genuine above-anchor reflow, not the
  //      "Shape B" straddler lurch. Losing this cross-check is exactly the W1
  //      sufficiency gap; it survives here because both reads are same-frame.
  //
  // Cost: the row walk runs ONLY when `|observedShift| > ε` — i.e. on
  // realization frames, the same frequency the RO fired at — so there is no
  // steady-state per-frame draw cost.
  //
  // Guards ported from the old RO path (both load-bearing):
  //   - Re-pick guard `prev.id === cur.id`: `snapshotReadingAnchor` re-selects
  //     the anchor by geometry every frame, so without this the shift would diff
  //     two DIFFERENT rows on a re-pick frame (constant during scroll).
  //   - Staleness skip: a large `scrollTop` delta since the previous frame means
  //     momentum is in flight and the two reads may not describe one coherent
  //     state — skip rather than fold the wheel into the pin.
  //
  // Mid-history is derived from SYNCHRONOUS geometry every frame
  // (`isAtBottomNow`), NOT from `anchorRef.current.kind` (scroll-event
  // maintained → stale under WebKit momentum). When at-bottom we clear the
  // anchor (bottom-glue in the RO effect owns that path); while a programmatic
  // bottom pin is settling we hold off — `onScroll` owns that window.

  // A deep-link target may live in older history that isn't in the DOM when
  // the route param first changes. The route screen fetches the target event
  // by id and splices it into `messages` asynchronously, so its row appears a
  // render or two later. We therefore key this effect on `messages` and bail
  // *without* marking the target handled until its row actually exists — each
  // subsequent message commit re-runs the effect and retries the centering.
  // ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // biome-ignore lint/correctness/useExhaustiveDependencies: `messages` is an intentional trigger, not a read — the effect reads the DOM (querySelector), and we need it to re-run each time the rendered row set changes so a target spliced into older history gets centered once its row commits.
