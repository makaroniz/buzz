/**
 * Measure the virtualized list's offset from the top of the scroll container's
 * scrollable content, to feed `useVirtualizer({ scrollMargin })`.
 *
 * The main timeline's scroll container holds content ABOVE the virtualized list
 * inside the SAME scrollable element: the pagination sentinel, the
 * "load older" spinner, and the channel/DM intro banner. `@tanstack/react-virtual`
 * positions items at `paddingStart + scrollMargin`, so without this the
 * virtualizer assumes row 0 sits at scrollTop 0 — but it's actually painted
 * `scrollMargin` px lower. That mismatch is what makes freshly-loaded rows
 * sandwich into the header/list seam and the viewport drift while rows fill.
 *
 * We re-measure whenever the above-content can change height (intro mount/
 * unmount, spinner toggle) AND via a ResizeObserver on the scroll container, so
 * the margin stays correct as content streams in.
 *
 * Returns both the margin and a `measured` flag. The flag matters because a
 * legitimate margin can be `0` (nothing above the list), so callers that must
 * not act on a STALE pre-mount margin — e.g. the first-load bottom pin — can't
 * just test `margin > 0`. `measured` flips true only after the list has mounted
 * and we've taken a real measurement, so the init pin can wait for a trustworthy
 * offset instead of pinning against the pre-mount `0` and flashing out of place.
